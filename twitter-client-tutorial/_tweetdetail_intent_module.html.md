# Loading Tweet Detail Activity using Intent

So far you have built a basic Tweet List screen. You also learnt how to attach Click Listener to each List item. As per our plan, you need to load a new Activity with details of the tweet when the tweet item is clicked on the ListView. 

Ideally, we would need to send the tweet data from the TweetList Activity to TweetDetail Activity but ince this is our first iteration of building the Twitter app & we are not doing any data handling, there will not be any data passed over Intent.

This module is similar to our earlier module where you learnt how to load the TweetList Activity from Login Activity on login button click.
