We are done storing login data from previous lessons. It is time to handle data for Tweet List Screen. 

In this module, we will add the feature - each tweet item should have different data. We will create a Tweet model which will store the data corresponding to each tweet. In subsequent lessons, we will learn how to serialize & read/write the Tweet model object array to a local file. 

> In this module, you will going to learn how to access & modify data in a ListView & best practices of storing data using models in Java/Android.
