In one of the previous modules, we were simply opening TweetDetail Activity on List item click in TweetList Activity. In this module, we will be passing tweet object over the Intent which is then used to popuplate the TweetDetail Activity.

There are multiple ways of passing data over Intent. It can be simple string, integer or can be an object of a class.
