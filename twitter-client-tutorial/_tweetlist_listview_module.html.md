So far, you learnt to work with relatively simple View elements like LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, TextView, EditText & Button. For building the list of tweet screen, we would be needing a different View element called **ListView**.

ListView is one of the most difficult concepts to understand for an Android newbie. To make it easier/simpler, we will be building TweetList screen in multiple iterations. The first iteration will be to build a very simple but useless ListView with just one TextView for each item. We are then going to refine it to come closer to our requirement. 

Below are the images as to how the ListView would be built in the lessons of this module.

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span5">
		<%= image_tag "twitter-client/twitter_list_view.png", alt: "Login screen Layout overview", title: "Login screen Layout overview" %>
	</div>
	<div class="span2">
		<div class="vertical-align-me">
			<%= image_tag "twitter-client/from-to.jpg", alt: "Login screen Layout overview", title: "Login screen Layout overview" %>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="span5">
		<div class="vertical-align-me">
			<%= image_tag "twitter-client/final_tweet_list.png", alt: "Login screen Layout overview", title: "Login screen Layout overview" %>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
