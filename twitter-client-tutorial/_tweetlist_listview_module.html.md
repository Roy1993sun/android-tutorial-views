So far, you learnt to work with relatively simple View elements like LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, TextView, EditText & Button. For building the list of tweet screen, we would be needing a different View element called **ListView**.

ListView is one of the most difficult concepts to understand for an Android newbie. To make it easier/simpler, we will be building TweetList screen in multiple iterations. The first iteration will be to build a very simple but useless ListView with just one TextView for each item. We are then going to refine it to come closer to our requirement.
