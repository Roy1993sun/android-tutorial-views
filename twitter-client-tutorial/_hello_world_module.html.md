In this tutorial, **you will build a Twitter App from scratch**. Our intent is to show the complete lifecycle of an app from scratch to production. The unique thing about this tutorial is - *you learn by building an app rather reading about the concepts*. We tried to keep the flow as close as possible to how real developers develop real apps.   

## Why you should learn from us 

It could be daunting for a total newbie to get into Android app development from day 1. To keep things simple & progressive, our App Tutorial flow is created such that :-

1. **Easier concepts first, difficult concepts later **

	Features required easier concepts are built earlier while the features requiring difficult concepts are pushed later. For example, we start with building the UI as it involves basic concepts like Activity & Layout, while pushing features like new tweet notification for later (work in progress).


2. **App features tweaked for optimal & gradual learning**

	If a feature is combination of multiple concepts involving some of the advanced ones, we break down the feature such that we do a sub-optimal build of the feature. For example, while introducing AsyncTask for network calls, we ask users to simulate the network call using a `Thread.sleep(..)` so that users can focus on just AsyncTask. 

3. **Small learning per lesson to avoid information overload**

	Each module is broken down into lessons such that the lessons has just enough feature for you to focus only on one concept (or part of concept) at a time. This is also done to ensure that we are able to test the feature & pin-point you of the exact error which we would probably not able to do if it is a bigger feature involving multiple concepts. 

4. **Get your app evaluated at every lesson ** 

	You get to build & get your app tested at every lesson through our Eclipse plugin which we also call Virtual Assistant. So you dont just learn by doing, you learn by building a real app with instant app evaluation. Our aim is to enhance our Virtual Assistant to the level that it should be able to hint & guide you based on your learning capabilities. As for now, it simply tells you the error message of the test that fails when it evaluates your app. 

5. **Newbie friendly language. Tutorial structured by experts but worded by learners**

	The language of our tutorial is very beginner friendly. **A lot of our users have told us this point**. Most of the tutorials are created by experts. Our tutorial structure is created by experts but the actual tutorial content is created by newbies who learn from this tutorial & then replace the complex statements with easier to understand lines & also fill in any newbie friendly information which experts have missed.

6. **Want to be a good developer ? Develop a lot of apps & not just your own**

	We understand that you have your own app ideas that you like to work on & probably not like to build *yet another Twitter app*. The only way you can become a decent developer is by creating a lot of apps. This way, **you not only understand Android concepts, but also the engineering behind app creation** like how to conceptualize an app, how to break a big feature into smaller features etc. Going through complete app development lifecycle is an important learning which you can use in your own Android app.
